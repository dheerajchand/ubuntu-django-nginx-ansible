Fiona
=====

Fiona is OGR's neat, nimble, no-nonsense API for Python programmers.

Fiona is designed to be simple and dependable. It focuses on reading and
writing data in standard Python IO style and relies upon familiar Python types
and protocols such as files, dictionaries, mappings, and iterators instead of
classes specific to OGR. Fiona can read and write real-world data using
multi-layered GIS formats and zipped virtual file systems and integrates
readily with other Python GIS packages such as pyproj_, Rtree_, and Shapely_.

For more details, see:

Usage
=====

Collections
-----------

Records are read from and written to ``file``-like `Collection` objects
returned from the ``fiona.open()`` function.  Records are mappings modeled on
the GeoJSON format. They don't have any spatial methods of their own, so if you
want to do anything fancy with them you will probably need Shapely or something
like it. Here is an example of using Fiona to read some records from one data
file, change their geometry attributes, and write them to a new data file.

.. code-block:: python

    import fiona

    # Register format drivers with a context manager

    with fiona.drivers():

        # Open a file for reading. We'll call this the "source."

        with fiona.open('tests/data/coutwildrnp.shp') as source:

            # The file we'll write to, the "sink", must be initialized
            # with a coordinate system, a format driver name, and
            # a record schema.  We can get initial values from the open
            # collection's ``meta`` property and then modify them as
            # desired.

            meta = source.meta
            meta['schema']['geometry'] = 'Point'

            # Open an output file, using the same format driver and
            # coordinate reference system as the source. The ``meta``
            # mapping fills in the keyword parameters of fiona.open().

            with fiona.open('test_write.shp', 'w', **meta) as sink:

                # Process only the records intersecting a box.
                for f in source.filter(bbox=(-107.0, 37.0, -105.0, 39.0)):

                    # Get a point on the boundary of the record's
                    # geometry.

                    f['geometry'] = {
                        'type': 'Point',
                        'coordinates': f['geometry']['coordinates'][0][0]}

                    # Write the record out.

                    sink.write(f)

        # The sink's contents are flushed to disk and the file is
        # closed when its ``with`` block ends. This effectively
        # executes ``sink.flush(); sink.close()``.

    # At the end of the ``with fiona.drivers()`` block, context
    # manager exits and all drivers are de-registered.

The fiona.drivers() function and context manager are new in 1.1. The
example above shows the way to use it to register and de-register
drivers in a deterministic and efficient way. Code written for Fiona 1.0
will continue to work: opened collections may manage the global driver
registry if no other manager is present.

Reading Multilayer data
-----------------------

Collections can also be made from single layers within multilayer files or
directories of data. The target layer is specified by name or by its integer
index within the file or directory. The ``fiona.listlayers()`` function
provides an index ordered list of layer names.

.. code-block:: python

    with fiona.drivers():

        for layername in fiona.listlayers('tests/data'):
            with fiona.open('tests/data', layer=layername) as src:
                print(layername, len(src))

    # Output:
    # (u'coutwildrnp', 67)

Layer can also be specified by index. In this case, ``layer=0`` and
``layer='test_uk'`` specify the same layer in the data file or directory.

.. code-block:: python

    with fiona.drivers():

        for i, layername in enumerate(fiona.listlayers('tests/data')):
            with fiona.open('tests/data', layer=i) as src:
                print(i, layername, len(src))

    # Output:
    # (0, u'coutwildrnp', 67)

Writing Multilayer data
-----------------------

Multilayer data can be written as well. Layers must be specified by name when
writing.

.. code-block:: python

    with fiona.drivers():

        with open('tests/data/cowildrnp.shp') as src:
            meta = src.meta
            f = next(src)

        with fiona.open('/tmp/foo', 'w', layer='bar', **meta) as dst:
            dst.write(f)

        print(fiona.listlayers('/tmp/foo'))

        with fiona.open('/tmp/foo', layer='bar') as src:
            print(len(src))
            f = next(src)
            print(f['geometry']['type'])
            print(f['properties'])

        # Output:
        # [u'bar']
        # 1
        # Polygon
        # OrderedDict([(u'PERIMETER', 1.22107), (u'FEATURE2', None), (u'NAME', u'Mount Naomi Wilderness'), (u'FEATURE1', u'Wilderness'), (u'URL', u'http://www.wilderness.net/index.cfm?fuse=NWPS&sec=wildView&wname=Mount%20Naomi'), (u'AGBUR', u'FS'), (u'AREA', 0.0179264), (u'STATE_FIPS', u'49'), (u'WILDRNP020', 332), (u'STATE', u'UT')])

A view of the /tmp/foo directory will confirm the creation of the new files.

.. code-block:: console

    $ ls /tmp/foo
    bar.cpg bar.dbf bar.prj bar.shp bar.shx

Collections from archives and virtual file systems
--------------------------------------------------

Zip and Tar archives can be treated as virtual filesystems and Collections can
be made from paths and layers within them. In other words, Fiona lets you read
and write zipped Shapefiles.

.. code-block:: python

    with fiona.drivers():

        for i, layername in enumerate(
                fiona.listlayers(
                    '/', 
                    vfs='zip://tests/data/coutwildrnp.zip')):
            with fiona.open(
                    '/', 
                    vfs='zip://tests/data/coutwildrnp.zip', 
                    layer=i) as src:
                print(i, layername, len(src))

    # Output:
    # (0, u'coutwildrnp', 67)

Fiona CLI
=========

Fiona's command line interface, named "fio", is documented at `docs/cli.rst
<https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona/blob/master/docs/cli.rst>`__. Its ``fio
info`` pretty prints information about a data file.

.. code-block:: console

    $ fio info --indent 2 tests/data/coutwildrnp.shp
    {
      "count": 67,
      "crs": "EPSG:4326",
      "driver": "ESRI Shapefile",
      "bounds": [
        -113.56424713134766,
        37.0689811706543,
        -104.97087097167969,
        41.99627685546875
      ],
      "schema": {
        "geometry": "Polygon",
        "properties": {
          "PERIMETER": "float:24.15",
          "FEATURE2": "str:80",
          "NAME": "str:80",
          "FEATURE1": "str:80",
          "URL": "str:101",
          "AGBUR": "str:80",
          "AREA": "float:24.15",
          "STATE_FIPS": "str:80",
          "WILDRNP020": "int:10",
          "STATE": "str:80"
        }
      }
    }

Installation
============

Fiona requires Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, or 3.4 and GDAL/OGR 1.8+. To build from
a source distribution you will need a C compiler and GDAL and Python
development headers and libraries (libgdal1-dev for Debian/Ubuntu, gdal-dev for
CentOS/Fedora).

To build from a repository copy, you will also need Cython to build C sources
from the project's .pyx files. See the project's requirements-dev.txt file for
guidance.

The `Kyngchaos GDAL frameworks
<http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks#gdal_complete>`__ will satisfy
the GDAL/OGR dependency for OS X, as will Homebrew's GDAL Formula (``brew install
gdal``).

Python Requirements
-------------------

Fiona depends on the modules ``six``, ``cligj``,  ``munch``, ``argparse``, and
``ordereddict`` (the two latter modules are standard in Python 2.7+). Pip will
fetch these requirements for you, but users installing Fiona from a Windows
installer must get them separately.

Unix-like systems
-----------------

Assuming you're using a virtualenv (if not, skip to the 4th command) and
GDAL/OGR libraries, headers, and `gdal-config`_ program are installed to well
known locations on your system via your system's package manager (``brew
install gdal`` using Homebrew on OS X), installation is this simple.

.. code-block:: console

  $ mkdir fiona_env
  $ virtualenv fiona_env
  $ source fiona_env/bin/activate
  (fiona_env)$ pip install fiona

If gdal-config is not available or if GDAL/OGR headers and libs aren't
installed to a well known location, you must set include dirs, library dirs,
and libraries options via the setup.cfg file or setup command line as shown
below (using ``git``). You must also specify the major version of the GDAL API
(1 or 2) on the setup command line.

.. code-block:: console

  (fiona_env)$ git clone git://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona.git
  (fiona_env)$ cd Fiona
  (fiona_env)$ python setup.py build_ext -I/path/to/gdal/include -L/path/to/gdal/lib -lgdal install --gdalversion 1

Or specify that build options and GDAL API version should be provided by a
particular gdal-config program.

.. code-block:: console

  (fiona_env)$ GDAL_CONFIG=/path/to/gdal-config pip install fiona

Windows
-------

Binary installers are available at
http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#fiona and coming eventually to PyPI.

You can download a binary distribution of GDAL from `here
<http://www.gisinternals.com/release.php>`_.  You will also need to download
the compiled libraries and headers (include files).

When building from source on Windows, it is important to know that setup.py
cannot rely on gdal-config, which is only present on UNIX systems, to discover 
the locations of header files and libraries that Fiona needs to compile its 
C extensions. On Windows, these paths need to be provided by the user. 
You will need to find the include files and the library files for gdal and 
use setup.py as follows. You must also specify the major version of the GDAL
API (1 or 2) on the setup command line.

.. code-block:: console

    $ python setup.py build_ext -I<path to gdal include files> -lgdal_i -L<path to gdal library> install --gdalversion 1

Note: The GDAL dll (gdal111.dll) and gdal-data directory need to be in your 
Windows PATH otherwise Fiona will fail to work.

Development and testing
=======================

Building from the source requires Cython. Tests require Nose. If the GDAL/OGR
libraries, headers, and `gdal-config`_ program are installed to well known
locations on your system (via your system's package manager), you can do this::

  (fiona_env)$ git clone git://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona.git
  (fiona_env)$ cd Fiona
  (fiona_env)$ pip install cython
  (fiona_env)$ pip install -e .[test]
  (fiona_env)$ nosetests

Or you can use the ``pep-518-install`` script::

  (fiona_env)$ git clone git://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona.git
  (fiona_env)$ cd Fiona
  (fiona_env)$ ./pep-518-install

If you have a non-standard environment, you'll need to specify the include and
lib dirs and GDAL library on the command line::

  (fiona_env)$ python setup.py build_ext -I/path/to/gdal/include -L/path/to/gdal/lib -lgdal --gdalversion 2 develop
  (fiona_env)$ nosetests

Changes
=======

All issue numbers are relative to https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona/issues.

1.7.0post2 (2016-06-15)
-----------------------

Packaging: define extension modules for 'clean' and 'config' targets (#363).

1.7.0post1 (2016-06-15)
-----------------------

Packaging: No files are copied for the 'clean' setup target (#361, #362).

1.7.0 (2016-06-14)
------------------

The C extension modules in this library can now be built and used with either
a 1.x or 2.x release of the GDAL library. Big thanks to René Buffat for
leading this effort.

Refactoring:

- The `ogrext1.pyx` and `ogrext2.pyx` files now use separate
  C APIs defined in `ogrext1.pxd` and `ogrex2.pxd`. The other extension
  modules have been refactored so that they do not depend on either of these
  modules and use subsets of the GDAL/OGR API compatible with both GDAL 1.x and
  2.x (#359).

Packaging:

- Source distributions now contain two different sources for the
  `ogrext` extension module. The `ogrext1.c` file will be used with GDAL 1.x
  and the `ogrext2.c` file will be used with GDAL 2.x.

1.7b2 (2016-06-13)
------------------

- New feature: enhancement of the `--layer` option for fio-cat and fio-dump
  to allow separate layers of one or more multi-layer input files to be
  selected (#349).

1.7b1 (2016-06-10)
------------------

- New feature: support for GDAL version 2+ (#259).
- New feature: a new fio-calc CLI command (#273).
- New feature: `--layer` options for fio-info (#316) and fio-load (#299).
- New feature: a `--no-parse` option for fio-collect that lets a careful user
  avoid extra JSON serialization and deserialization (#306).
- Bug fix: `+wktext` is now preserved when serializing CRS from WKT to PROJ.4
  dicts (#352).
- Bug fix: a small memory leak when opening a collection has been fixed (#337).
- Bug fix: internal unicode errors now result in a log message and a 
  `UnicodeError` exception, not a `TypeError` (#356).

1.6.4 (2016-05-06)
------------------
- Raise ImportError if the active GDAL library version is >= 2.0 instead of
  failing unpredictably (#338, #341). Support for GDAL>=2.0 is coming in
  Fiona 1.7.

1.6.3.post1 (2016-03-27)
------------------------
- No changes to the library in this post-release version, but there is a
  significant change to the distributions on PyPI: to help make Fiona more
  compatible with Shapely on OS X, the GDAL shared library included in the
  macosx (only) binary wheels now statically links the GEOS library. See
  https://github.com/sgillies/frs-wheel-builds/issues/5.

1.6.3 (2015-12-22)
------------------
- Daytime has been decreasing in the Northern Hemisphere, but is now
  increasing again as it should.
- Non-UTF strings were being passed into OGR functions in some situations
  and on Windows this would sometimes crash a Python process (#303). Fiona
  now raises errors derived from UnicodeError when field names or field
  values can't be encoded.

1.6.2 (2015-09-22)
------------------
- Providing only PROJ4 representations in the dataset meta property resulted in
  loss of CRS information when using the `fiona.open(..., **src.meta) as dst`
  pattern (#265). This bug has been addressed by adding a crs_wkt item to the`
  meta property and extending the `fiona.open()` and the collection constructor
  to look for and prioritize this keyword argument.

1.6.1 (2015-08-12)
------------------
- Bug fix: Fiona now deserializes JSON-encoded string properties provided by
  the OGR GeoJSON driver (#244, #245, #246).
- Bug fix: proj4 data was not copied properly into binary distributions due to
  a typo (#254).

-----------------
- Python 2/3 compatibility in a single package. Pythons 2.6, 2.7, 3.3 now supported.

0.12.1 (2013-04-16)
-------------------
- Fix messed up linking of README in sdist (#39).

0.12 (2013-04-15)
-----------------
- Fix broken installation of extension modules (#35).
- Log CPL errors at their matching Python log levels.
- Use upper case for encoding names within OGR, lower case in Python.

0.11 (2013-04-14)
-----------------
- Cythonize .pyx files (#34).
- Work with or around OGR's internal recoding of record data (#35).
- Fix bug in serialization of int/float PROJ.4 params.

0.10 (2013-03-23)
-----------------
- Add function to get the width of str type properties.
- Handle validation and schema representation of 3D geometry types (#29).
- Return {'geometry': None} in the case of a NULL geometry (#31).

0.9.1 (2013-03-07)
------------------
- Silence the logger in ogrext.so (can be overridden).
- Allow user specification of record field encoding (like 'Windows-1252' for
  Natural Earth shapefiles) to help when OGR can't detect it.

0.9 (2013-03-06)
----------------
- Accessing file metadata (crs, schema, bounds) on never inspected closed files
  returns None without exceptions.
- Add a dict of supported_drivers and their supported modes.
- Raise ValueError for unsupported drivers and modes.
- Remove asserts from ogrext.pyx.
- Add validate_record method to collections.
- Add helpful coordinate system functions to fiona.crs.
- Promote use of fiona.open over fiona.collection.
- Handle Shapefile's mix of LineString/Polygon and multis (#18).
- Allow users to specify width of shapefile text fields (#20).

0.8 (2012-02-21)
----------------
- Replaced .opened attribute with .closed (product of collection() is always
  opened). Also a __del__() which will close a Collection, but still not to be
  depended upon.
- Added writerecords method.
- Added a record buffer and better counting of records in a collection.
- Manage one iterator per collection/session.
- Added a read-only bounds property.

0.7 (2012-01-29)
----------------
- Initial timezone-naive support for date, time, and datetime fields. Don't use
  these field types if you can avoid them. RFC 3339 datetimes in a string field
  are much better.

0.6.2 (2012-01-10)
------------------
- Diagnose and set the driver property of collection in read mode.
- Fail if collection paths are not to files. Multi-collection workspaces are
  a (maybe) TODO.

0.6.1 (2012-01-06)
------------------
- Handle the case of undefined crs for disk collections.

0.6 (2012-01-05)
----------------
- Support for collection coordinate reference systems based on Proj4.
- Redirect OGR warnings and errors to the Fiona log.
- Assert that pointers returned from the ograpi functions are not NULL before
  using.

0.5 (2011-12-19)
----------------
- Support for reading and writing collections of any geometry type.
- Feature and Geometry classes replaced by mappings (dicts).
- Removal of Workspace class.

0.2 (2011-09-16)
----------------
- Rename WorldMill to Fiona.

0.1.1 (2008-12-04)
------------------
- Support for features with no geometry.

Fiona would not be possible without the great work of Frank Warmerdam and other
GDAL/OGR developers.

Some portions of this work were supported by a grant (for Pleiades_) from the
U.S. National Endowment for the Humanities (http://www.neh.gov).
